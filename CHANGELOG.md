# Changelog

Continuous-improvement log for the agentic dev process itself, produced by
the `/retro` Skill (`~/work/lis-engineering/skills/workflow/retro/SKILL.md`).
One entry per `/retro` invocation — whether or not it actually changed a
file. Not a product changelog; see git history / PR descriptions for that.

- **Friction:** `Skill(skill-creator)` returned `Unknown skill:
  skill-creator` this session even though it was the named skill to use for
  a task; the plugin exists on disk
  (`~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-plugins-official/plugins/skill-creator`)
  but wasn't loaded. Root-caused (not guessed) to
  `~/.claude/settings.json`'s `enabledPlugins`, which lists other plugins
  but not this one. Same-turn workaround: read the plugin's `SKILL.md`
  directly and followed it manually.
- **Area:** other-process
- **Change:** added a standing note to `AGENTS.md`'s "Rules of engagement"
  documenting the gotcha, the same-turn workaround, and that the real fix
  (enabling the plugin) is a global settings change owned by the
  `update-config` skill, not something to hand-edit here.
- **Files:** `AGENTS.md`
